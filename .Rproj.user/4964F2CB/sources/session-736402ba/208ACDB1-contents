## Quarto Slide Transition

**none:** No transition (switch instantly) [^1]

[^1]: This is the default

. . .

**fade:** Cross fade

. . .

**slide:** Slide horizontally

. . .

**convex:** Slide at a convex angle

. . .

**concave:** Slide at a concave angle

. . .

**zoom:** Scale the incoming slide so it grows in from the center of the screen.

. . .

## This Slide Zooms in and Fades out {transition="zoom-in fade-out" transition-speed="slow"}

You can also set the transition in the *YAML* header with:

`transition: zoom-in fade-out`

and

`transition-speed: slow`

::: aside
Note, the *YAML* transition cannot be overwritten by individual slides.
:::

## Loading the Estonia Dataset {transition="fade-in slide-out"}

We use the `rio` and the `tidyverse` package to load the *Estonia* data set.

The code does not matter too much.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
library(rio)
library(tidyverse)
DataEstonia=import("https://econ.lange-analytics.com/RData/Datasets/estonia-passenger-list.csv") 
```

## Variables in the Dataset

There are several variables in the *Estonia* dataset.

Here are the variables:

::: incremental
-   ID
-   First name
-   Last name
-   Country
-   Survival Status
-   Sex
-   Age
-   Category
:::

## Generating Dataset with Few Variables - First Trial

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "1,|2-3,|4"
library(tidyverse)
DataEstoniaNew=DataEstonia |> 
               select(PassengerId, Sex, Survived)
head(DataEstoniaNew)
```

## Generating Dataset with Few Variables - Better Flow

```{r }
#| code-line-numbers: "1,|2-3,|4"
#| output-location: fragment
library(tidyverse)
DataEstoniaNew=DataEstonia |> 
               select(PassengerId, Sex, Survived)
head(DataEstoniaNew)
```

## Graphing Age and Survived

```{r}
#| output-location: slide
#| code-line-numbers: false
ggplot(DataEstonia, aes(x=Survived, y=Age))+
   geom_jitter()
```

## Optional Slides Handling

- Should I show shameless advertising for my Machine Learning book on the next slide???
    - No!
- I added `{visibility="hidden"}` after the slide's title.
- However there is a more flexible way.

## Shameless Advertising for Machine Learning Book {visibility="hidden"}

Note, the footer link has changed

::: footer
<a href="https://ai.lange-analytics.com/htmlbook" target="_blank">Free Version Link</a>

# 5. Reveal Themes (Scss) with `Jarrod`

## Topics to Cover:

-   Choosing and using themes
-   Customizing themes
-   Creating themes
-   Sass Variables / CSS

## Choosing and Using Themes

RevealJS offers a variety of built-in themes. To choose or use a theme:

::: incremental
1.  **Select a Theme:** You can either choose a built-in theme or provide your own via a custom SCSS file. <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/themes.html>
2.  **Link the Theme:** In your YAML header, set the `theme` option to your SCSS file. For example:
:::

. . .

``` yaml
format:
  revealjs:
    theme: [default, theme.scss]
```

This tells RevealJS to use your custom styling for the presentation.

## Customizing Themes

::: callout-tip
-   Customization allows your slides to reflect your branding.
-   With SCSS, you can easily override default styles.
-   For example, to change the style of your headings and links, you might use:
:::

. . .

``` scss
.reveal h1, .reveal h2, .reveal h3 {
  font-family: $font-primary;
  font-weight: bold;
}

.reveal a {
  color: $citrus !important;
  &:hover {
    text-decoration: underline;
  }
}
```

-   Experiment with these rules to adjust colors, fonts, and layout elements to your liking. <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/themes.html>

## Creating Themes

::: incremental
-   Creating your own theme involves:
    1.  **Starting from Scratch:** Create a new SCSS file.
    2.  **Defining Variables:** Set up your color palette, typography, and other style constants.
    3.  **Writing Rules:** Develop CSS rules targeting RevealJS slide elements.
    4.  **Linking in Quarto:** Reference your SCSS file in the YAML header as shown earlier.
-   This process gives you full control over your presentation’s appearance.
:::

## Reveal Themes (SCSS) {style="height:1000px;"}

-   `RevealJS` allows us to use SCSS for more powerful theming. In this section, we'll look at how our SCSS file defines styles for our presentation.
-   **Key concepts:**
    -   **SCSS Variables:** Reusable values for colors, fonts, etc.
    -   **SCSS Rules:** Custom styles for headings, text, code blocks, and more.
    -   **Integration:** How our SCSS theme overrides default RevealJS styles.

. . .

-   Below is a snippet from our `theme.scss` file (for demonstration):

``` scss
/* SCSS Variables for Cal Poly Pomona Branding */
$cpp-green: #00693D;
$cpp-gold:  #FFB81C;

// Typography
$font-primary: Arial, sans-serif;
$font-body: Arial, sans-serif;

.reveal {
  font-family: $font-body;
  color: $black;

  h1 {
    font-size: 2.5em;
    color: $cpp-green !important;
  }
  // ...
}
```

## Sass Variables / CSS

-   Sass variables are at the core of our theme’s flexibility. For instance:
    -   **\$cpp-green:** Used for primary headings and controls.
    -   **\$cpp-gold:** Defines secondary highlights and accents.
    -   **\$teal, \$citrus, etc.:** Additional colors for links, progress bars, and code blocks.

. . .

-   Changing a variable’s value in one place updates your entire theme—making maintenance and updates very efficient.

## Demo: Applying the Theme

-   [Let's see the custom theme in action!]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
-   [Notice how the defined styles (fonts, colors, code block designs) immediately change the look of your slides.]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}

. . .

|      **Live Experiment:**

. . .

-   Try modifying a variable (e.g., `$cpp-green`) in your `theme.scss` file, then refresh the presentation to observe the changes.

## Conclusion

- Today we covered:
    -   **Reveal Themes (SCSS):** Understanding how SCSS integrates with RevealJS.
    -   **Choosing & Using Themes:** Linking and selecting themes via the YAML header.
    -   **Customizing Themes:** Overriding default styles with your own SCSS.
    -   **Creating Themes:** Building a custom theme from scratch.
    -   **Sass Variables / CSS:** Using variables for efficient, consistent styling.
- Feel free to experiment with the code and make the theme your own!

## Thank You!
